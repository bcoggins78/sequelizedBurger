This week introduced the use of Sequelize. This is a node based app that uses JavaScript in place of MySQL database queries.

This project uses:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Sequelize



#### Instructions

This app allows you to type in any hamburger you would like to eat.  Each entry is entered into the database with the default devoured state of "false".  This puts the hamburger in the left column ready to be devoured. When the user clicks the "Devour it!" button beside the hamburger, the devoured state is changed to "true" which moves it to the devoured column.
